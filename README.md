### Hi 👋🏻

I'm Jack (he/him), a current math PhD student at the University of Washington. Before coming to UW, I graduated from Smith College with a BA in Math (and Statistics, technically) in 2021.

### Some Quick Facts

- 📚 I'm interested in using algebraic structure in optimisation, machine learning, and data science
- 👨🏻‍💻 I enjoy data analysis and am always working to improve my technical skills
- 🇬🇧 I'm British but write in an unfortunate mixture of British and American English
